This is a reimplementation of the method proposed in "Cooperatively Coevolving particle swarm optimization for large scale optimization" [1].

The 'src' folder contains the experiment code written to run the experiments from the original article.

The 'Results' folder contains the results achieved from re-running the experiments.
